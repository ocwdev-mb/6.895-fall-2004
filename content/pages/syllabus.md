Course Information

### Instructor

Prof. Madhu Sudan

### Description

This course introduces the theory of error-correcting codes to computer scientists. This theory, dating back to the works of Shannon and Hamming from the late 40's, overflows with theorems, techniques, and notions of interest to theoretical computer scientists. The course will focus on results of asymptotic and algorithmic significance. Principal topics include:

1.  Construction and existence results for error-correcting codes.
2.  Limitations on the combinatorial performance of error-correcting codes.
3.  Decoding algorithms.
4.  Applications in computer science.

Prerequisites
-------------

[6.046J](/courses/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005) and mathematical maturity.

Grading Policy
--------------

Grading in this course will be based on four problem sets, scribe work, and possibly one term paper.

Some standard references for coding theory are listed below. We won't follow any particular one of these. But the material covered can probably be found (in some disguise or other) in any of these.

While 6.895 and 6.451 have a fair amount of overlap the courses do have significantly different emphasis to allow for students to benefit by taking both courses.
